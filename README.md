# Portfolio

Crossword: Automatically generates crosswords by enforcing arc consistency, node consistency, backtrack, and optimizing heuristics like the least values constraining heuristic and the degree heuristic.

Minesweeper: AI that automatically plays the game Minesweeper using inference. Demonstrates knowledge of object oriented programming, propositional logic and game design.

Nim: Reinforcement learning AI that is trained 10000 times to play the game Nim, a combinatorial game that is also a form of an impartial game.

PageRank: Smaller scale version of Google's search algorithm utilizing knowledge of Markov Chains, power iteration, vectors and matrices.

Tictactoe: AI that automatically plays the game Tictactoe using recursion and the minimax algorithm from game theory. Demonstrates knowledge of game theory and its implementation in artificial intelligence.

Further additions incoming, keep watching this space!
