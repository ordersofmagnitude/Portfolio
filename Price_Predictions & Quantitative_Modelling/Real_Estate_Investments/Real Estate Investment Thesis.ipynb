You are tasked with the job of building a model to predict the fair value of houses on well-known datasets such as the Ames, Iowa market and assess the type of renovations that would increase the value of the houses. Your CIO is interested in knowing whether this strategy will generate alpha (profit) and is worth pursuing."
