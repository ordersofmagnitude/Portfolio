    "\n",
    "People in the investment management industry are constantly looking for new sources of alpha. In recent times, family offices, asset managers & hedge funds in London have been seeking alpha in luxury wine and fine art. We are interested in knowing whether this can be applicable to the luxury whiskey market.\n",

    "One of the first technical indicators that a trader performing old-school technical analysis is introduced to is the moving average. The moving average comes in several forms, including simple moving average, exponential moving average, and weighted moving average. The Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing is a triple moving average function that performs smoothing and also checks for seasonality - the presence of cyclical trends in the data. A multiplicative model will be used because of the resilience of its results."

    "Addition of time dummies and lagged data drastically worsened the predictability of Macallan prices (RMSE of 0.97 instead of the 0.289 shown here). This, along with the Granger causality matrix for Macallan high and average prices, suggests that past prices of other factors do not predict Macallan high prices, and that Macallan high prices may depend on other exogenous factors not accounted for by the model (eg. sentiment, hype). The branding and sentiment of the whiskey is likely to have greater influence over its price as compared to quantitative factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Hibiki, the addition of time dummies + lagged data caused a better performance than adding lagged data alone (best score for lagged data: 0.132, vs 0.1233 for time dummies) - suggesting that seasonality and other time factors may be pertinent in price determination/prediction. Further analysis will be elucidated under \"Feature Importances\".\n",
